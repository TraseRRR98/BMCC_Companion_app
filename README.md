# BMCC_Companion_app
CS project for AI Innovation challenge
We believe that all students, traditional or non-traditional deserve to have an enjoyable experience when engaging in their academic affairs. Although being a college student may be difficult at times, we hope our Companion application lessens the burden college may ‘seem’ to be. By creating a hub for students to get help in classes, get connected with events and opportunities, and outside resources.
Through an AI chatbot to students will be able to test their knowledge and to better aid their learning. Also by providing a mental health chat box that help students handle the stresses that higher academia may have.
